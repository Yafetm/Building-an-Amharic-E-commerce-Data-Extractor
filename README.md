# Building an Amharic E-commerce Data Extractor

This repository contains the code for the 10 Academy KAIM Week 4 challenge, focused on building an Amharic Named Entity Recognition (NER) system to extract entities from Ethiopian Telegram e-commerce channels.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data (not uploaded to GitHub).
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data ingestion and preprocessing.
- `README.md`: Project overview.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files/folders to ignore.
- `LICENSE`: Project license.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Yafetm/Building-an-Amharic-E-commerce-Data-Extractor.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up `.env` with Telegram API credentials.

## Progress
- **Task 1**: Implemented data ingestion (`data_ingestion.py`) and preprocessing (`preprocessing.py`) .
- **Task 2**: Planned (NER labeling).

## Next Steps
- Label data in CoNLL format for NER.
- Fine-tune NER models using Hugging Face.
